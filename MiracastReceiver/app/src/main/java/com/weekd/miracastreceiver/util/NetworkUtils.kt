/**
 * NetworkUtils — Helper functions for reading network interface information.
 *
 * WHY: The AirPlay protocol requires the receiver to advertise its MAC address
 * and device name via mDNS TXT records. This class provides clean, safe methods
 * to read this information from the Android system.
 *
 * HOW: All methods are static (on the companion object) — no instance needed.
 * Read the device name and MAC address once at startup and pass them to MdnsService.
 *
 * Example:
 *   val name = NetworkUtils.getDeviceName(context)   // "My Android TV"
 *   val mac  = NetworkUtils.getMacAddress()           // "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
 *   val uuid = NetworkUtils.getPersistentUuid(context) // stable UUID per device
 */

     * important that it matches what the user set in their TV's settings.
     *
     * Sources tried in order:
     * 1. Settings.Global.DEVICE_NAME (Android 5+, most TVs)
     * 2. Settings.Secure.BLUETOOTH_NAME (Bluetooth device name, often same as device name)
     * 3. Fallback: "PhairPlay" (if neither source is available)
     *
     * SECURITY: The returned value is sanitized — mDNS service names must not contain
     * certain special characters. We strip any character outside [A-Za-z0-9 _-].
