/**
 * AudioPlayer — Decrypts and plays the AirPlay audio stream.
 *
 * WHY: AirPlay audio arrives as encrypted RTP packets over UDP.
 * Before the audio can be played, it must be:
 * 1. Received from the UDP socket
 * 2. Decrypted (AES-128-CBC cipher, IV reset per packet)
 * 3. Decoded (AAC-ELD or ALAC frames → PCM audio)
 * 4. Played through the TV's audio output (AudioTrack)
 *
 * This class handles steps 2-4. Step 1 (UDP receiving) is handled by RtspHandler
 * which calls [playAudioPacket] for each received packet.
 *
 * HOW:
 *   val player = AudioPlayer()
 *   player.initialize(aesKey, aesIv, sampleRate, channels)  // call once with SDP params
 *   player.playAudioPacket(encryptedRtpPayload)              // call for each UDP packet
 *   player.release()                                          // call when done
