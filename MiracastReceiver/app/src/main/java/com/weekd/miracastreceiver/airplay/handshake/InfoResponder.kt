/**
 * InfoResponder — builds the binary-plist body for `GET /info`, the first request a macOS
 * AirPlay sender makes. It advertises the receiver's identity and capability bits so the
 * sender knows to continue with pairing → FairPlay → mirroring.
 *
 * Values are kept consistent with what [com.weekd.miracastreceiver.airplay.MdnsService] advertises so the
 * sender sees one coherent device.
 *
 * NOTE: the Ed25519 public key (`pk`) is added in the pairing phase once a persistent
 * identity exists; macOS still proceeds to pair-setup without it.
